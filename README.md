Spectral power density models and Spectral Representation Method

## Introduction
Stochastic process models are responsible for characterising ground motions, representing the stochastic excitations applied upon engineering structures[^1]. To this end, a series of power spectral density models are developed and employed in stochastic dynamic analysis[^2]. Notably, Kanai Tajimi model plays a foundational role[^3]. Beyond which, nonstationary model attract more attention in recent years.
